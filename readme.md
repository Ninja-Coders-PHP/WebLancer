### Steps to keep in mind
- Clone/download this repo.
- Create your filename.php and in your file include the header.php and footer.php
- Also, the head part of the html page will remain the same as the home.php.
- Make a CSS file --> filename.css
- The font color used is : #021F3C 
- Put images under images folder.
- Also added a sample copy of form elements, so you can directly use from here. 
- If you want to change some styling feel free to do but please dnt change the header,footer and contact file as they are templates.  
- Currently no need to upload on github.
